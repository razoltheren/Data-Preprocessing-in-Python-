## Introduction to Python  
* Python Development Environments
* Data types
* Data Structure
* Control Strutures
* Loop and iterations
* Functions

## Jupyter notebooks  
* Setting up and using Jupyter notebooks
* Using the browser efficiently       

## Numpy 
* Why Numpy(demonstrate less memory, fast and convenient)
* Arithmetic functions in Numpy
* Numpy Aggregation functions
* Sorting arrays
* Comparison operators
* Broadcasting
* Array manipulations(attributes,indexing,slicing,reshaping,joining and splitting of arrays)
* Using array for different data problems
* Vectorization

## One dimesional data structure of Pandas
* How to import the Series from a DataFrame
* Sorting values, also sorting on index values
* Inplace : for overwriting the existing Series
* 'in' keyword in SERIES
* Extracting the values based on the Index position
* Maths methos on the SERIES
* idxmax(index max) and idxmin(index min) method
* value_counts on Series
* Using apply method over a Series
* map for the Series

## Importing using Pandas
* How to import a csv file in python. Checking the shape and the appearence of the dataset?
* How to import an excel file in python, also extracting data from different tabs?
* We do have a dataset and column names for the dataset. Unfortunately they are not together, then how to align them?
* How to export the dataset in form of a csv file?
* What are the other readers functions of Pandas commonly used?
* How to import the Series from a DataFrame

## Handling the missing values using Pandas
* Handling missing value data using fillna as 0?
* Filling NAN with different values for different columns?
* Using ffill and bfill to copy the before and after value within a column
* Replacing the NAN values vertically
* Droping the NA values on the basis of the conditionality
* When we want to replace the outliers(or other values) with NAN.
* Replacing different values (column wise) not just the NAN ones, this time dictionary will come in rescue.
* Giving numerical value to the categorical data for the problem solving purpose.

## Two dimensional Datastructure of Pandas
* How to set a meaningful column to be the index?
* How to reindex a column from default one for a meaningful outcome.
* How to check the data types of the imported file. If the type is wrong then how to transform it to the desired type?
* Renaming a column?
* Adding a new column to an existing dataframe
* Deleting rows or columns from a dataframe
* Sorting dataframes on the basis of columns
* Retaining the subset of the dataframe on basis of one condition
* Applying multiple conditions on the datasets
* Usage of isin for multliple conditions in a single column
* Using the duplicate method over a dataframe
* Cheking the unique and nunique methods
* The copy() method
* loc and iloc
* apply, map and applymap
* Applying function to a Series in Pandas(value_counts).
* Finding out unique values in the dataset and replacing the column values
* How can I find and remove duplicate rows?
* Introduction to Groupby
* Dealing with multiindex
* Renaming a multindex
* How to use the transpose
* Swaping (swaplevel)the multindex
* Stacking
* Getting the random sample out of the DataFrame
* concatenating
* merging
* reshaping (pivoting)

## How to address date in Python
* What is datetime in Python
* Introduction to Timestamp
* Difference between the datetime and Timestamp
* Extracting date, day and month format in Timestamp
* Converting column from the string/int to datetime object
* creating new columns (for months, date and year) from the datetime column
* some mathematical operations over the date column
* truncate and offset method over the column

## String handling capability of Python
* How categorization of a string can save on the memory
* String operations on column values:
* lower() - turning everything into lowercase
* title() - first character in uppercase, rest as lower case
* len() - length of the characters present in each cell
* replace() - replace any existing string value from the cell
* contains() - whether some sub string is contained in the entire string.
* strips() - getting the whitespace out of the string
* get() - take out certain string from the cell.

## Matplotlib  
* Introduction with relevance
* Basic plots(line,bar,histogram,Scatter,stack,pie chart and heat map)
* Labels, titles, legends and other customization for better understanding

## Introduction to Sklearn
* Sklearn vision and goals
* Features of sklearn
* The most common steps used in sklearn
* Popular group of models found in sklearn
