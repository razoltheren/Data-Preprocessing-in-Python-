    "##### Qualitative or categorical types (non-numeric types)\n",
    "1. `Nominal data`: pure labels without inherent order\n",
    "2. `Ordinal data`: labels with an intrinsic order or ranking (comparison operations can be made between values)\n",
    "##### Quantitative or numeric types\n",

    "Discrete quantitative variables can only take on a specific set values at some maximum level of precision.\n",
